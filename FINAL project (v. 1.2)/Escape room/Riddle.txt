You click ‘Start game’. You spawn in the hallway. There are four doors in total, but two of them are locked,
these being the main exit and one other door marked “Circuit Room.” You know that the key to the main exit is
in the Circuit Room, so you must find the code to open the door

The doors to the “Radiator Room” and the “Storage Room” are both open. 


In the “Radiator Room” a riddle is written on the wall. 

“Reaching stiffly for the sky, I bare my fingers when its cold. In warmth I wear an emerald glove and in between I dress in gold.” (The answer is tree)


In the “Storage Room” there are letters with corresponding numbers on the wall. 

N=0
B=1
A=2
T=3
R=4
S=5
E=6
O=7
I=8
G=9

So, the code is 3466 (TREE).

There is also a locked chest on the floor. 
Corresponding the right numbers to the right letters gives you a code that opens the door into the “Circuit Room.” 

The key fits the lock for the chest in the “Radiator Room”. In that chest is a keycard, which makes the main door open.
