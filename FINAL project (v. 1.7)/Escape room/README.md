Removed the conditional statement: if 50 clicks = game over as there was no reason to have this feature.

Added sound effect for closed door, locked door and when the correct key on the keypad has been entered

Solved the sound glitch when the user clicked on the 'Go back to hallway' button while being in the hallway

Also removed the text appearing when hovering over the 'Go back to hallway' button while being in the hallway
