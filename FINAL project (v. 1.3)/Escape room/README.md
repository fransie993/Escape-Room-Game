Created a "Go back to hallway" feature

Created an inventory

Implemented the riddles (yet not functional)

Made two doors unable to be opened until the key has been found and code from riddle entered (will be tough to make these function properly)

Photoshopped the hallway and added a fourth door and made it fully functional
